**TASK 3 â†’ MULTI - CLOUD ARCHITECTURE**

**COMPANY**: Codtech IT Solution
**NAME**: Srinidi R
**INTERN ID**: CITS0D437
**DOMAIN**: Cloud Computing
**DURATION**: 4 Weeks
**MENTOR**: Neela Santosh

**ðŸ“„ DESCRIPTION**

This task focused on designing and implementing a **multi-cloud architecture** by integrating services from both **AWS** and **Microsoft Azure**. The architecture aimed to leverage the strengths of each platform â€” using AWS S3 for static website hosting and Azure for backend processing via serverless functions. The project enabled cross-platform communication through APIs and illustrated how hybrid cloud models can deliver scalability, flexibility, and resilience.

**ðŸŒŸ FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

* Hosted a static website using **AWS S3** (HTML + JavaScript).
* Created **API integration** between the frontend (hosted on AWS) and the backend (hosted on Azure).
* Used **Azure Function / App Service** to handle backend logic or processing requests from the S3-hosted site.
* Demonstrated **interoperability** between AWS and Azure.
* Built a **serverless and cost-efficient** web architecture using cloud-native services.

**ðŸ›  TECHNOLOGIES USED**

* **AWS S3** â€“ for static website hosting
* **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** â€“ for frontend development
* **Azure Functions / Azure App Service** â€“ for backend API processing
* **REST API** â€“ for communication between S3 frontend and Azure backend
* **Cloud-based tools** â€“ for deployment and testing

**ðŸ”— HOW TO ACCESS THE FILE**

1. Visit the **AWS S3 hosted website link** (publicly accessible URL of your static site).
2. Interact with the frontend (HTML + JS), which triggers API requests to Azure.
3. The **Azure backend function** receives and processes the API calls and sends a response.
4. The response is rendered on the frontend, completing the multi-cloud workflow.

> âœ… *Note: Make sure the S3 bucket has public read permissions enabled and CORS policy configured to allow cross-origin requests to Azure.*
